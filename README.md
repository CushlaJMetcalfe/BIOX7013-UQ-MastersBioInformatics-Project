Series of scripts to 
1. Curate gut metagenomic metadata from NCBI SRA respository selecting records that
  a. Use whole genome sequencing
  b. Sequencing run > 2Gb
  c. Sequencing platform has max read length > 100bp

2. Process selected sequencing reads
  a. Preprocess - quality trimming & filter human reads
  b. Classify and estimate abundance at species level
  c. Rarefaction
  d. Alpha diversity
  e. Extract E. coli reads and classify to strain level
